## Problem Statement Setup
Imagine Pinball and a maze like this, Now one has to put the balls in the maze for a number of time let's say this "N". there are few assumption: 1. No ball will be out of the container placed below 2. At each pin (dot in the figure) ball has only two options : either (left/right). 
we have to guess if we do this for a large number of times n -> infinity

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$
